# Exercise 8: React Q&A

_Goal: First steps with React applications. Create a "HeapOverrun" question page based on a tree of components (and props)._

## Creating a project

Create a new React project called **react-qa**, activate it and explore its files. Insert into `App.jsx` the code for loading a 'fake' set of questions and answers in JavaScript objects.

## Defining the component tree

Starting from the screen of the "HeapOverrun" question page (see Exercises 6-7), make a list of the components that you need to recreate the page.

For each component, list the information (`prop`s) that are required by that component (and/or by any other enclosed component).

## Implementing the components

Create a file `Components.jsx`, and define the React components as functions, and modify the App to render those components.

The components should **not** be interactive, yet.
