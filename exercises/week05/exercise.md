# Exercise 6: Q&A HTML+CSS skeleton

Create a prototype of the user interface of the Q&A website, "HeapOverrun", using HTML and CSS.

The website consists of two web pages:

- A page `index.html` showing a table with the list of all questions (for each question show its number, question text, author email, and date). Each question should link to the second page.
- A page `answers.html` showing all the answers to the question selected in the previous page. The page should display the information about the question, plus a table containg all the given answers. An example of the answers page is given in the [PDF document](./qa-webpage-mockup.pdf) in this same folder.

In this exercise, the web pages must be static (no interactive features), and the reported data will be hard-coded in the HTML source.

Use the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library to help styling the layout and the appearance of the page. For compatibility with future libraries, use version `5.3.x` of the library.

In class, we will develop the second page (`answers.html`), while the first one (`index.html`) is left to the students.
